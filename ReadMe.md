# JamUp

JamUp is a work-in-progress that aims to let anyone make music using simple scripting. This comes with the added benefit that anyone who's interested in making music, and willing to use this tool, will also learn some scripting.

## Usage

JamUp is still in development and should have an updated usage by next week. Currently only works on Mac for file loading.

Essentially, you type lua code into the text field to orchestrate audio events.

More details to come soon.
